This code provides a Cocoa-friendly wrapper around libssh2's SFTP functionality, including:

- `NSFileManager`-esque methods for common operations, including recursive directory creation
- `NSFileHandle` subclass for convenient handling of file contents
- Encapsulation of errors using `NSError`
- Create of socket etc. needed for connecting, all from a simple `NSURL`
- `NSURLConnection`-style authentication handling, including support for public key auth, and checking against known hosts file
- Transcript output for your logging/diagnostic purposes

##Supported Platforms
- Mac OS X 10.5+
- In theory, iOS, but not tested at all yet

##Usage

Add these three files to your project:

- CK2SFTPSession.*
- libssh2.dylib

For file writing or reading, you are likely to also want these two files:

- CK2SFTPFileHandle.*

And to authenticate using a public key, add these two files:

- CK2SSHCredential.*

###Connecting to an SFTP server

1. Create a `CK2SFTPSession` instance, supplying the server's URL, and your delegate
2. The delegate is called once connected so you can asynchronously (e.g. ask the user first) supply a credential to authenticate with. If auth fails, you have as many shots at it as the server allows
3. Internally, an SFTP channel is opened up and the delegate is informed, ready for it to start issuing commands

If at any point the connection fails, the delegate is notified.

###Multi-threading

`CK2SFTPSession` presently uses libssh2's blocking API, so you should generally use it on a background thread. Fortunately `NSOperationQueue` makes this nice and easy. We use the same threading model as libssh2, so session instances (and their file handles) are free to be used on any thread, but only one at a time.

##Dependencies

Requires libssh2 1.2.8 or later. A pre-built `libssh2.dylib` is supplied, plus an Xcode project for building your own copy if needed.
